How to Run -
Like mentioned in the report, the basic steps are -
* Running a server instance first
* Doing file operations
* NOTE - the folder names are fixed to a certain strings right now as submitted; changing these would create errors
* Running sync.py file for synchronization
* Performing ADD/SORT operations
